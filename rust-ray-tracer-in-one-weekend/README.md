# Another "Ray Tracing in One Weekend" implementation in Rust

## About
This is my first Rust project after completing the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) (Chapters 1-19).  Translating a language (C++) into Rust puts all the things I learned about Rust into practice. Since this is my first project, my Rust skills are quite dull, and the coding/design style will be evidence of that. :sweat_smile:

After implementing a roughly featureful Ray Tracer (i.e. complete books 1, 2, and parts of 3), I plan to use the concepts I learned from here and make my own Rust Path Tracer that is hopefully more idiomatic, uses some Rust Crates, and possibly even faster!
